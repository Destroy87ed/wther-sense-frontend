# Weather Sense - Frontend

The frontend of this project is built using **React**, serving as the backbone of the application.  
It handles routing and rendering of multiple sub-components, including:

- Visually appealing dashboard page
- Welcoming page
- Intuitive login/register pages

These pages are designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a smooth and engaging user experience.

To interact with the backend and the Weather API, the frontend uses the **Axios** library for secure GET/POST requests, enabling seamless data exchange.
